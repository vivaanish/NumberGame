# ðŸŽ® Number Game â€“ CET137 Assessment 1

Hi, Iâ€™m **Anish Pangeni**, and this is my submission for **CET137 Assessment 1 â€“ Scenario 1: Number Game**.  
Itâ€™s a simple console-based game written in **C#** where the goal is to beat the computer by getting the **lowest score** across 3 rounds.

---

## ðŸ“Œ About the Game

- Each round, both the **player** and the **computer** get two random cards (values from 1 to 8).
- Your **score** is the **absolute difference** between the two cards.
- You can **swap one card per round** to improve your score.
- The **computer automatically swaps** cards until its score is less than 3.
- After 3 rounds, the total scores are compared and the **winner is decided**.
- All moves are **logged to `gamelog.txt`**.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Built entirely with **basic C# concepts** like:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Loops & Conditionals
  - Methods & Encapsulation
  - File I/O using `StreamWriter`
- Designed for the **console**, so everything runs in the terminal.
- Encourages strategic thinkingâ€”especially when deciding whether to swap or not.
- Includes a **tie-breaker system** based on card totals if scores are equal.
